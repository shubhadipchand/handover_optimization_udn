#Handover Optimization in 5G Ultra Dense Networks using Deep Q Networks#

This project implements a efficient handover optimization scheme over 5G Ultra Dense Networks also comparing with traditional handover algorithms like the A3 Handover. 
The efficiency of the DQN agent can be evaluated after its training period. The generated plots also can be useful to strengthen the argument.
